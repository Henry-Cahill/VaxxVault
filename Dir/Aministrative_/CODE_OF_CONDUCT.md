# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We're committed to making our community a harassment-free space for everyone. No matter your age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientationâ€”you belong here.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Positive actions that foster a great community include:

- **Showing empathy and kindness**: Consider others' feelings and perspectives.
- **Respecting different viewpoints**: Embrace diversity of opinion and experience.
- **Giving and receiving constructive feedback**: Offer helpful feedback and be open to it when others provide it.
- **Owning up to mistakes**: If you mess up, apologize and learn from it.
- **Prioritizing the community**: Think about what's best for everyone, not just yourself.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- **Using sexualized language or imagery**: This includes unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- **Trolling or insulting comments**: Personal attacks or derogatory remarks aren't tolerated.
- **Harassment**: Both public and private harassment is unacceptable.
- **Sharing others' private information**: Don't disclose someone's details without explicit permission.
- **Unprofessional conduct**: Any behavior that wouldn't be appropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They'll take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct. They'll communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and when an individual publicly represents the community. This includes using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community leaders at [henry.lawrence.cahill@howtoosoftware.com](mailto:henry.lawrence.cahill@howtoosoftware.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders must respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for any violations:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Minor use of inappropriate language or behavior that's unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning clearly stating the nature of the violation and explaining why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. For a specified period, you will not interact with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this time. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
