## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to set up your workspace and start contributing.

### Forking the Repository

Begin by forking the main repository to create your own copy:

1. Navigate to the [VaxVault GitHub page](https://github.com/Henry-Cahill/VaxxVault).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the upper right corner.
3. GitHub will create a personal copy under your account.

### Cloning Your Fork

Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VaxxVault.git
cd VaxxVault
```
Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### Setting Up the Environment

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Install the Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate all forms of contributions, from code to documentation. Here's how to make your contributions count.

### Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and readability:

- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python code.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Include docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

### Commit Messages

Crafting insightful commit messages helps others understand your contributions:

- Start with a short summary in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add data validation for input fields").
- Provide additional detail in the body if necessary.
- Reference any relevant issues or pull requests.

**Example:**
```bash
Improve data parsing in the vaccine_data module

- Handle edge cases with missing data

- Optimize loop for performance

Closes #42
```

#### Sync with Upstream

Ensure your fork is up to date:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Henry-Cahill/VaxxVault.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

### Create a New Branch

Work on a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
### Make Your Changes
You can just make your changes with descriptive messages.

### Push to Your Fork
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Open a Pull Request
